## Project Description
This application simulates a theoretical back end framework for a Social Media API using MongoDB/NoSQL. It could potentially be paired with a front end in order to create some kind of Social Network application with full functionality. Since there is no front end, the routes may be tested with Insomnia, as shown in the demo.

## Installation
To install, simply clone the project and run "npm i" to install the required dependencies.

## Usage
As stated in the description, since there is no front end provided, the API may either be used and paired with a front end of your choice or simply tested with Insomnia. Run the server ("node index in your command line") and look in the routes folder to view or edit your API routes.
